# WiseFul
An expense tracking app that allows kids to create categories and add expenses to the categories. The client can set a limit to how much one can spend in each category.
Since our clientele is kids (ranging from age 10 to 16), the design is simple and easy for young kids to navigate. The client can click "Add Category," and input the name of the category and the amount of maximum spending. This will create a new section below so that the client can start adding expenses. Clicking "New Expense" allows clients to input Description, Amount and Budget, where the Budget contains category that clients have created before. After creating a new expense to a certain category, The progress bar and and the number will rise, and the expense will be shown as a list in the same category.
