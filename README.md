# WiseFul
An expense tracking app that allows kids to create categories and add expenses to the categories. The client can set a limit to how much one can spend in each category.
Since our clientele is kids (ranging from age 10 to 16), the design is simple and easy for young kids to navigate. The client can click "Add Category," and input the name of the category and the amount of maximum spending. This will create a new section below so that the client can start adding expenses. Clicking "New Expense" allows clients to input Description, Amount and Budget, where the Budget contains category that clients have created before. After creating a new expense to a certain category, The progress bar and and the number will rise, and the expense will be shown as a list in the same category.

## My First Budget App 
Build a budget app for a kid who just got their first bank account. A user should be able to create categories and assign money to those categories. There should also be some guardrails, warnings, etc to help guide the user. 

We estimate this assignment to take < 4 hours. Here are the requirements: 

* **Use our stack**: Typescript, React, Express. 
* **Include documentation and tests**; it should be easy for a reviewer to read and understand. 
* **Flex your skills!** This assignment is intended to be a base for you to extend. Play to your strengths and show us what you can do. Senior candidates are encouraged to add at least one feature. You do not need to include authentication. Focus on demonstrating what the app can do. 

Email fn@palolo.com any time with questions.

## Quickstart 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
